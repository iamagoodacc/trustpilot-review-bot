When I order online, they are pretty much always out of stock on certain non-perishable items, like tobacco. So I am not sure why they are allowed to advertise these items when they are NEVER in stock (week after week), and always get refunded. This is false advertising and very irritating. I will be using a different online supermarket from now on. [PERSON] seems good and not much more expensive- much higher quality products as well. Asda often delivers products that have gone off- the tomatoes AND the red pepper delivered [DATE] are both on their way out already. No point in trying to buy products cheaper if they are never in stock or already rotting! Very disappointing as I used to sing Asda's praises all the time.",

[ANONYMIZED] When I started ordering with them it was relatively easy to contact customer service if anything was wrong - this has become more complicated and takes longer.3. On this last occasion I had absolutely no notification from Asda about the delivery (usually you get a text and an email which tells you what's missing or subbed).  I wasn't even sure the driver would be coming and it's far too frustrating trying to contact anyone.  [ANONYMIZED] items were missing, both of which were important and if I had received an email or text to notify me I could have gone out to a local shop to replace these items.On a final note, the rewards look good on the face of it, but the 'missions' are ridiculous and the star buys are usually not relevant to me.Overall I feel the service has gone down to a level where I will not be using Asda for home delivery again.",

What started as a convenient option has become increasingly frustrating.[ANONYMIZED], the quality of the substitutions has become laughable. Items that are nowhere near comparable to what I've ordered are being sent as replacements, showing a complete lack of care and consideration. It feels like the staff simply can't be bothered to put in any effort when picking out alternatives as well as just throwing them in to break.The rising prices are another concern. It's no secret that grocery prices have gone up everywhere, but it seems particularly bad with Asda. To make matters worse, as prices soar, the quality of the food has noticeably dropped. Fresh produce doesn't last as long, and items often arrive looking less than fresh. It's disappointing to see the standards slip so drastically.Overall, Asda's delivery service from [ANONYMIZED] is becoming more of a hassle than a help. I really hope they can address these issues, but for now, I'm seriously considering taking my business elsewhere.",

I searched the whole chilled section and could not find the product. When I asked a staff member they started pointing to where the chilled sections were. I pointed out that I knew where the section was, but I could not find a specific product, so I needed a staff member to assist in finding the product. This was huffed at and the staff member then asked another staff member to go with me to the chilled section. I had expected that the staff member would search for the product using some device, but no they walked to the chilled section and just looked at shelves, as I had already done. I asked the staff member is they could not search using a device and was told no as the online info codes were different. I have since purchased the product from Tesco! Where the store member searched for the product using a device!Asda your store standards have seriously dropped. Products being unavailable that were previously available. Less staff to support in store.I planned to send this directly to the store manager as feedback. But as you\u2019ve removed that online option I have had to resort to a public statement.

This issue was at the Asda in Dewsbury store, [LOCATION]. [PERSON], I am emailing you to raise a serious complaint regarding the service I received [ANONYMIZED] in the Dewsbury store. I have been using an Asda reloadable shopping card for [DATE] but since the new tills were installed I have had problems using my card. [DATE] this issue caused me severe anxiety and embarrassment. I packed my shopping, scanned my reward card and handed over my shopping card to pay for my groceries. The cashier tapped the card but nothing happened so she tapped it again. She then informed me my card had nothing on it. I explained I use the card [DATE] and top it up [DATE] so there was definitely a credit balance on my card. She tried it again then pressed for a manager to attend. We waited but got no response so she called him again. Then she asked the lady on the till in front for help. The cashier finished with her customer then came around to assist. She mentioned this issue had happened before and showed the teller how to get the balance on the screen. They did this and then informed me the balance was showing as [ANONYMIZED]. I said again this was incorrect. The teller tried for a [ANONYMIZED] time to call the manager but because he was not wearing his headset the call was again ignored. By this time the queue was beginning to get longer and I was getting more upset, so much so that I began to suffer a panic attack. I got my bank card out and said I would pay that way instead. The teller said I shouldn't have to when there was credit on my shopping card. She called for the manager again but he did not respond. The teller infront suggested trying the card [ANONYMIZED] more time and low and behold the screen showed a credit balance of [ANONYMIZED]. I paid for my shopping and apologised to the customer behind me for taking so long to get sorted. As I left the store shaking I walked past the manager who was laughing with a colleague and still not wearing the headset. If I had not been in such a state I would have said something but I couldn't. Due to this incident I had to take a betablocker to ease the panic attack and stop the shaking to enable me to drive home. I have not had to do this for [DATE] and I am very angry that I had to take a tablet [DATE] because of the anxiety caused by something that was not my fault. This is not the [ANONYMIZED] incident using my shopping card but it is definitely the worst. I would appreciate it if you could get your tills sorted out so I do not have to go through this embarrassment again.",

        "body": "I had a really frustrating experience with my recent online order. I've been a regular customer for [DATE], but this time, things went wrong.[DATE], I placed an order to be delivered to my flat. I received a message confirming the delivery time between [ANONYMIZED]. Since I have a large dog and for safety reasons, I usually meet the driver outside on the street. When I got a text saying my delivery was next, I went downstairs at [ANONYMIZED]. However, by [DATE], the driver hadn't arrived, so I went back up to my flat as I couldn't get internet access from the street. At [ANONYMIZED], I received a message that the driver was outside, but when I went back out, no one was there. I waited until [ANONYMIZED], but still no sign of the driver, so I went back inside, deciding to wait for the driver to call me before going outside again.I received a message that the driver was running late and would arrive by [ANONYMIZED] hrs. At [ANONYMIZED], I got a message that the driver was on his way and would be with me ASAP. Since I usually go to bed early and needed to get up at [ANONYMIZED], I checked my messages again, and it still said the driver was on the way. Frustrated, I called an emergency contact number I found for ASDA and was told that my order had been cancelled. I was very annoyed as I had been waiting outside for [ANONYMIZED] despite the message indicating that my order was on its way. I was offered a new delivery time for [DATE] at [DATE] and was assured that I wouldn't be charged for delivery. I had to log back into my account and authorize payment again, but the lady assisting me had set up the delivery free of charge.However, when I checked my account on [DATE] at [ANONYMIZED], it said that my order had been delivered [DATE] at [ANONYMIZED]. This led me to call the emergency number again, and a male operator told me to log into my account and pay again. This was very frustrating as I had already gone through the payment process, and it seemed that the previous lady had not sorted out my delivery as promised.So, I went through the authorization and payment process again and finally organized delivery for the earliest slot [ANONYMIZED] ([DATE]). I paid again and went through bank confirmation once more. When I checked my bank account, I found that the bank was holding [ANONYMIZED] payments for my shopping, and there was [ANONYMIZED] delivery charge on my bill.My shopping finally arrived, but there were some substitutes I was not happy with, so I returned them. There were also [ANONYMIZED] broken eggs in the box. I also noticed that a refund had been made to my account.I ordered vitamin E tablets at \u00a3[ANONYMIZED], but I received vitamin D, for which I was only charged \u00a3[ANONYMIZED]. I returned the vitamin D, but the refund I received was only \u00a3[ANONYMIZED], which was incorrect.The original order number was [DATE], with a total balance of \u00a3[ANONYMIZED]. However, the order that arrived [DATE] was [DATE] and had an added \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] delivery charge, despite being told it would be free. There were a couple of amendments, and the total bill came to \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] called and confirmed my delivery time, but my bank is showing [ANONYMIZED] payments for you - \u00a3[ANONYMIZED], \u00a3[ANONYMIZED], and \u00a3[ANONYMIZED], totalling \u00a3[ANONYMIZED]. Also, I received an ASDA refund to my account for \u00a3[ANONYMIZED], which was unclear to me. This whole experience has been frustrating and inconvenient, especially considering the long wait times and multiple payment issues.I complained directly to Asad on their emergency number, the guy gave me a customer service email address to complain to, I spent [ANONYMIZED] putting my complaint together to find the email address was no longer valid. ([PERSON], Why would customer service cancel their email address? )Too many complaints, maybe?But for [ANONYMIZED] waiting outside, [ANONYMIZED] waiting for my orders to be delivered, Asda did say I could have \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] off my next online order.We will see, they said I could have free delivery, but I got charged for it.The term [LOCATION] comes to mind, (Sorry, any younger readers will have to look that phrase up.)",

        "title": "[PERSON] ~ Shockingly Abysmal Home Delivery Service & Customer Service",
        "body": "Asda's home delivery service is not even worthy of [ANONYMIZED] star. I had been ordering Asda home deliveries since [DATE], and my previous experience [DATE] is certainly going to be my final experience with them. Before I chose Asda, I used to order shopping from Tesco, which I never had any issues with. However, due to the cost of living skyrocketing in [DATE], I opted to try shopping with Asda as I found their products significantly cheaper. Big mistake!Their product availability is abysmal ~ [ANONYMIZED] occasion in [DATE] where they actually had all of the items in my shopping with [ANONYMIZED] substitutes. Not only that, but their constant substitutions were poor. [ANONYMIZED] time, I ordered an aubergine, they sent me a cucumber instead\u2026 on another occasion I ordered a grout pen and they sent me a super glue pen\u2026 both completely irrelevant/significant items! Every time I ordered a delivery, I was always emailed [DATE] after the order asking to give feedback. I constantly responded to them and stated that their product availability was awful but clearly was a waste of time because nothing changed. They don't listen to their customers. Their payments for home deliveries are completely backwards. They take money out [DATE] before the order arrives, and then if products are unavailable and/or the substitutes are no good, then waiting for a refund took somewhere between [DATE]\u2026 basically they are quick to take the money out but when you require the money back? Different story entirely.When something goes wrong and you contact Asda, the level of service is mostly atrocious. It is a common pattern that they are unapologetic, unwilling to help and they do not resolve issues unless you ring them several times and chase them up.[DATE], I was due a home delivery and the delivery driver rung me during my delivery slot to say my delivery was cancelled due to their van breaking down, which was frustrating however I get these things happen sometimes. The driver was very unapologetic and blas\u00e9 about the whole ordeal, he asked if I could come out and collect it ~ I don't drive plus I live a [ANONYMIZED] drive away; I explained this to him. He also asked if I knew of anybody else that could collect it, at this time I explained to him that if I was a driver then I wouldn't even be ordering a home delivery service and I wouldn't be paying extra for a delivery fee\u2026 He also told me that somebody would be in touch with me the following day to reschedule the delivery. Surprise surprise - nobody contacts me. So I ring Asda, to which they tell me that I in fact have to reschedule the delivery. So I arranged for [DATE], I had to pay yet another delivery charge in which I was told I would have it refunded as I had to pay a higher delivery fee, of no fault of my own! So my shopping arrives, I then asked the delivery driver if he knew how long it would be before I would receive a refund for the rescheduled delivery fee. He very abruptly told me to ring customer service and that he couldn't help me. Completely unnecessary and uncalled for. As I was packing away my shopping, I noticed that [ANONYMIZED] of my fridge items was [DATE] out of date and as the delivery driver had already gone at this point, I once again rung Asda. I explained the situation and they apologised, though their apology came off very disingenuous, sadly like a lot of their customer service advisors. I feel like they aren't actually sorry that I'm having an issue, I feel like they're only saying sorry because it's their job to say it.There's been other poor delivery experiences, where they have turned up much earlier than the time allocated on multiple occasions. They have delivered crates where products have carelessly packed at the store, and so have been damaged or spilled in the process. In those instances I've had to spend more time cleaning up than actually packing the damn items away. Some of the drivers genuinely stink. There was [ANONYMIZED] occasion where I didn't want a substitute, was told that I would have it refunded, however never received an email or any confirmation so had to call up Asda and chase up.Final straw was [DATE] I ordered a home delivery and it never turned up. I rung Asda and explained the situation. I was told I would receive an email [ANONYMIZED] later from the credit team. Still no response [ANONYMIZED], I ring Asda again. Was told exactly the same thing as the [ANONYMIZED] person. [ANONYMIZED] later I finally receive an email to say sorry if I haven't got the order but afraid they can't process my refund as my order was marked \"correctly delivered to me\" by [PERSON]. I rung Asda for a [ANONYMIZED] time and they finally agreed to refund me the full amount. The sheer audacity of them trying to take [ANONYMIZED] from me is SHAMEFUL. If you want an easy and non headache-inducing shop, then avoid Asda like the plague. ",

The incident not only caused significant delay and inconvenience whilst I was already running short of time, but also resulted in undue embarrassment due to the behavior of [ANONYMIZED] of your staff members.Upon arriving at the fuel station, I followed the usual procedure to fill my vehicle. However, before leaving I was abruptly and rather rudely interrupted by a staff member, [PERSON], who accused me of not paying the correct about of money. Despite my attempts to explain and clarify the situation, the staff member continued to argue in an extremely rude and dismissive manner.I paid \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] for fuel at the checkout. However, the \u2018manager\u2019 [PERSON] incorrectly claimed that I had only paid \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] and insisted that I needed to pay an additional amount. Despite my assurance that I had paid the correct amount, the staff member continued to argue with me in an aggressive and confrontational manner. To resolve the dispute, I checked my bank statement and provided evidence that I had indeed paid \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] than acknowledging her mistake, she falsely accused me of paying at the wrong till because she claimed I had stated the wrong till number. This accusation was completely unfounded and highly unprofessional. When I was finally refunded \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] to rectify the payment error, the cashier was unable to provide me with a refund receipt, adding to my frustration and inconvenience.The entire episode caused an unnecessary delay, leaving other customers visibly frustrated and creating an uncomfortable scene. I felt embarrassed and humiliated by the unwarranted attention and the accusatory tone used by your employee. To exacerbate the situation, it was eventually confirmed that I had been correct all along, and the staff member\u2019s actions were unjustified.Moreover, [PERSON]\u2019s extremely accusatory tone and refusal to apologise for the confusion was very unwelcoming and loud in front of other customers, wrongly insisted that I had given an incorrect till number, which was not the case. I clearly stated the correct till number multiple times, yet the employee continued to argue with me in a highly unprofessional manner.When I enquired about the complaint procedure, [PERSON] was highly reluctant to give me any information. When I insisted, it was revealed that she was in fact not the manager of the store but the supervisor and had misled me. This dishonesty further compounded the poor experience and reflects a serious issue in staff integrity and customer service at your store.I expect a certain level of professionalism and courtesy from Asda and Esso staff, and this incident fell far short of those expectations. Such behavior is unacceptable and does not reflect well on your company\u2019s reputation for customer service.I request a formal apology from the staff member involved and assurances that such an incident will not occur again. Additionally, I would appreciate an explanation of the steps Asda and Esso will take to prevent similar occurrences in the future.",

        "body": "[ANONYMIZED] time I've done an online shop with Asda, and I must admit, I saw so many bad reviews that I was a bit dubious. I don't know anyone in my area who uses Asda either, so nobody to get an opinion from. I really wanted the Jack Daniels that was on offer, and sods law, it was the only item that was subbed, apart from a couple of packets of rice! I received an email beforehand too, informing me of the subbed items, so I had time to decide whether I would keep them or not. I couldn't amend my order by then, so I would have had to return them via the driver. I decided to keep the 'subs' anyway, and I received the price difference as a refund into my bank account [DATE]. I was really pleased with everything, from ordering, (except I couldn't find out how to request no substitutes), to delivery. I bought lots of items that my local store doesn't sell, so have lots of new products and flavours to try. I didn't order any fresh/chilled  items, except fruit and breakfast shakes, as I don't always trust people to pick up long dated products. The dates on the items I did buy were really good. I also ended up having to contact customer services to query something, as the chat option on the app couldn't really help. I got through straightaway, and my question answered. The driver came [ANONYMIZED] early, luckily I was in. He was really helpful and friendly. The delivery prices are cheap too, especially if you choose [ANONYMIZED], or [ANONYMIZED] as I did. So, maybe I was just really lucky, but I cannot fault the experience I had with Asda. [ANONYMIZED] thing I noticed though, there was no date on when special offers were due to end, I couldn't see anything anyway. That would be a really useful feature to include.  ",

You have to wade through all the options, listen to the recorded voice trying to get you to put the phone down (saying \"they are very busy\", and \"best to get help online or in the app\" etc), you finally get to the queue, with rubbish and on hold music for ages, then there is a \"[ANONYMIZED]\" and the call ends.

I asked for a refund (online) for [ANONYMIZED] rump steaks I ordered that had 02/07/2024 and was refused.  Steaks normally have [DATE] on them, usually really good dates.  My husband took the delivery whilst I was out and didn\u2019t check the dates otherwise I would have handed them back to the driver. When you order the steak online it says [DATE] of shelf life ???  Why am I being refused refund when you\u2019ve delivered something with [DATE] shelf life.[ANONYMIZED]",

        "body": "I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with the service I received regarding my recent online order #3832484001255.On [DATE], I placed an order with Asda mobile and paid \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] for [DATE] delivery, expecting the delivery to be completed [ANONYMIZED] and [ANONYMIZED]. However, the service I received was far from satisfactory.During the specified delivery time, I received a notification that my order had been received. Upon contacting the delivery person, I was told to wait [ANONYMIZED] as the notification was sent mistakenly. Despite waiting, the order did not arrive within the extended timeframe. After [ANONYMIZED], I contacted the same individual again. I was informed that the [PERSON] driver who was supposed to deliver my order had canceled the ride, but the app still indicated that my order was delivered. This is highly misleading and unacceptable.When I asked for a resolution, I was told to rebook the order. I inquired whether I would need to pay again despite already paying and not receiving the original order. The response was that I would indeed have to pay again, which is absurd. I paid for a service that was not fulfilled. During my [ANONYMIZED] call, I was put on hold for [ANONYMIZED], only for the call to be dropped without any resolution. I called again from same number, same guy asked the order number and when we gave the order number, it was hung up on our face. I had to call back from a different number, only to go through the entire ordeal again. Same guy was there, and he said this is my [ANONYMIZED] call.This experience has been extremely frustrating and unprofessional. I am extremely disappointed with the way this situation has been handled. I paid for a service that was not delivered, and instead of rectifying the issue, I was asked to pay again. I demand a full refund for the undelivered order and [ANONYMIZED] paid for [DATE] delivery service. Furthermore, I expect a clear explanation of what went wrong and what steps you will take to ensure this does not happen again.Please address this matter urgently. I would appreciate a response within [ANONYMIZED] to confirm that my concerns are being taken seriously.Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.Date of experience: [DATE]",

I get that they need a break but it's always during times when they are meant to be open. [DATE] for example I arrived at 1:46pm and it was closed with a sign saying the pharmacist was on a break from [ANONYMIZED] to [ANONYMIZED]. There was a lady (tired after her shift that started at [ANONYMIZED]) who'd been there waiting since [DATE].  It was meant to be open from [ANONYMIZED] according to the website.  She was unable to go home and come back again. When she was finally served she was told she'd have to wait [ANONYMIZED]. Another customer turned up having been told to come after [ANONYMIZED] for an over-the-counter item only to find it closed. The pharmacist arrived back after [DATE]. The other staff had no update on where he was and made no attempt to acknowledge anyone waiting. I feel they were embarrassed and not wanting confrontations. When it was my turn to be served I was told prescriptions take [ANONYMIZED]. It's hard enough getting a GP appointment, but when you finally do there's more hassle trying to get meds. Again, I'm all for staff getting breaks. But you need to set people's expectations. Many people  rush out in their limited lunch hour at work to get their prescriptions.  It makes sense that the staff lunch breaks not be around a typical lunch hour. If you are just going in for the 'over-the-counter' items you cannot get them either if the pharmacist is not there. This really needs to be addressed. No wonder customers get  frustrated - and then the poor counter staff are left to deal with them. FYI - I've come away without my medication [DATE] and have to make a special trip back there later. Even then it may not be ready as they are stating [ANONYMIZED] for prescriptions. This is even when the script has been sent across electronically [DATE].It's probably better to go the pharmacy near [ANONYMIZED] or if you are mobile use the one on Burnham High Street. It's better equipped to serve customers. [[Edit - so after being told to come back after [ANONYMIZED] - I went back at 6:20pm and it was CLOSED AGAIN with a sign saying open again at 6:45pm. This is disgraceful customer service. You need to make a change to the open times on the website so that people don't have (multiple) wasted journeys]]",

It's not a pleasant shopping experience,Asda needs to be using those staff to keep the shelves full for people travelling to the store to buy, and have a separate store or warehouse where staff are employed to walk round, free of the burden of customers, picking and dispatching Internet orders.  Asda is a [ANONYMIZED] company, it can afford to have an Internet warehouse at a different location, like [LOCATION], to deal with the volume of online custom.Just to add,  your staff are always polite and helpful.

Furthermore, they show that the items are available, but I have noticed they don't provide suitable alternatives for the main items like [PERSON] or flour. So, I had to order the [ANONYMIZED] main items from [ANONYMIZED] different brands so that I could receive [ANONYMIZED]. I understand that sometimes items are unavailable, but not every time the main items are. By the way, I have used a different email address for Asda delivery.",

However, I have recently noticed that a huge number of the cheaper items have disappeared from their online website which is forcing online customers, and disabled people to buy the more expensive option. I have even been instore to make sure that these items have not been discontinued. They have not.I visited the store after [DATE] of being told online that the item is unavailable, yet lo and behold [DATE] all items were available instore. Our shopping is picked from the very store that I visited and were available at the time of placing my order.Some (but not all) of these items are: Essentials spaghetti ([DATE]) where as the next cheapest shown is [DATE]. Essentials beans and sausage, apple sauce, [PERSON] own wholemeal pittas, the large garlic granules, (the same item at [ANONYMIZED] the weight but at the same price is available online.) Essentials natural yoghurt has also disappeared except for the [ANONYMIZED] style which is more than double the price. These are just a small number of the items that have been removed from their online website.I do believe they are penalising their online customers by removing these items and are forcing them to pay the higher price.  If I am having to travel to a store then it may longer be beneficial for me to go to Asda if they are penalising their disabled and infirm customers by forcing them to pay for the higher priced goods. Cannock store gave me a phone number which sends me round in circles, I also emailed their customer service email address and the email bounced back to me as the address is no longer in use. I eventually got through to [LOCATION], but struggled to get them to understand my dilemma and no one has replied. It is extremely difficult to get in touch and ask a question without being directed through an automated service. Sometimes us customers need to actually speak to a real person as not all questions can be answered by an online Q & A.

It had mould spots [DATE]....before the use by date. Shelves were full of empty boxes and several products were unavailable, a frequent occurrence lately. The quality of the fresh fruit and veg has worsened too. The self checkout is not good. Not working properly and waiting ages for [ANONYMIZED] over-run staff member to constantly clear the machine after every [ANONYMIZED] or [ANONYMIZED] items. On my latest visit they had run out of their own brand of tiger loaf, the system went down causing long queues and were they unable to give the asda rewards as promised. The quality, choice and availability is getting worse whilst prices are getting higher. Seriously considering shopping elsewhere even though it is further away. If it continues this way I think Asda will disappear as people will vote with their feet Such a pity as it used to be a great place to shop. What on earth has happened?",

[ANONYMIZED]\", \"Recently Purchased\" sections seem to behave differently every time. Whenever I want to find something on the website, for example reviewing my delivery pass - it is rarely clear how to find this quickly - especially when using mobile.The website is not very intuitive at all and I really can't imagine older users finding it at all straight forward. As I would probably be considered a young \"tech savvy\" person, and still have difficulty.Another example of a glaringly obvious issue:  I recently purchased a [DATE] Midweek Delivery pass from Asda.com [DATE].  However, due to a change in personal circumstance - I wished to change [DATE] and so needed to buy the \"Full\" pass.You would think there would be a straight forwards option to just upgrade my pass to a [DATE] pass (and pay the \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] difference) but No. I was told multiple times on the phone this wouldn't be possible and I can \"wait till my pass expires in [DATE]\". It was only when I pressed that this seemed very foolish as I literally was trying to give them more money for a different pass that she spoke with her manager and they had to Refund my current pass so I could buy the upgraded version.  Really?  Very backwards service I have to say.ASDA generally stocks lots and lots of ultra-processed / processed items and I would like to see a continued development of their products such as their range of spices & fresh ingredients to make real, healthy food at home!

Then [ANONYMIZED] mins to pack bags as shopping stacjed high.Not happy and told them I would complain. No apology for any inconvenience and I spent \u00a3[ANONYMIZED]. Phoned Manager and his attitude the same as [PERSON], staff shortages since new owners taken over and will not pay overtime, but he would speak to [LOCATION] and see why she did not jump on a till due to the size of my shopping. Again no apology, so asked him to ring me back. Still waiting! Called again [DATE] for an update and he was too busy to come to the phone. [PERSON] a chance to rectify this, but Managers are not bothered,  disgraceful customer service, they have lost a good customer as I am off to Tesco who have till operators on from [ANONYMIZED], or [PERSON] and [PERSON] who start at [ANONYMIZED]. If others do this Asda profits will diminish and they only have themselves to blame.",

My most recent experiences: I visited the store on [DATE] and they had no stock of compost ([ANONYMIZED] 40L for \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] - a good deal). I then put through a separate order online for collection on [DATE] (which was fulfilled by ASDA [LOCATION]). [ANONYMIZED] ([ANONYMIZED]) of my order was missing due to being out-of-stock, including: [ANONYMIZED] Head & Shoulders shampoo 400ml for \u00a3[ANONYMIZED], crumpets and muffins. [ANONYMIZED]. The ASDA helpline put me through to the store, but the associate at the store obviously didn't realise I was on the other end of the line and I heard him say that \"he has no time to deal with the customer's complaint\" and that the complaint about stock availability \"was nonsense\". I then indicated to him that he was indeed speaking to the very customer who laid the complaint. I got told he'd get the store manager to contact me. I'm waiting for that to happen.It's really poor that ASDA makes it difficult to report incidents like this. It's poor that a customer is regarded by store management as being too time-consuming. It's poor that stock is unavailable, especially for competitively-priced promos. The only positive in all this was the helpline representative was courteous and willing to help.",

On my [ANONYMIZED] visit I dropped my card somewhere in store and despite searching was unable to find it (I had only been in the clothing section when I realised it had slipped from my hand.  It hasn't been handed in to customer services and I asked if it was possible to cancel the card in case someone had picked it up and tried to use it/ or it wasn't found.  I was told this wasn't possible, despite me having the receipt for it and there was nothing they or I could do if I hadn't registered the card when I received it.  I had been given no information regarding registering the card when I was given it.  I feel that the lack of information given regarding the need to register the card and the inability to stop acard should it be lost or stolen leaves customers very vulnerable to being out of pocket. Please ensure staff inform customers about the need to register their card and enable cards to be stopped if they are lost or stolen [ANONYMIZED]",

Got [ANONYMIZED] different brands, [PERSON] and B&J, of ice cream that were on \"offer\", when I scanned the [ANONYMIZED] brand [ANONYMIZED] the price didn't match and I called the lady that was working there and she said that didn't know and will call someone. The [ANONYMIZED] lady came, I said the price didn't match what was on display and she went to check, came back and she said \"I couldn't find it, can you show me\". I have to leave everything at the till to show someone who works there where the ice cream was. When I got there, I showed her and she said, \"Oh, see, they're in the wrong place, that's why you're confused. I told her how could there be [ANONYMIZED] pots in the wrong place? Not just [ANONYMIZED] pot that someone misplaced, but [ANONYMIZED]. The price tag said B&J, but the flavor was different. OK, I said, no problem. When I went back to the till and scanned the [ANONYMIZED] one, Wall's, the same thing. The cashier asked me if I wanted to go by myself to double check, and I said: \"No, I don't want anything else. You can charge my whole shop because I'm leaving\".It's so disrespectful because it's a very bad intentional way of getting money from people who never check the price and without realising are paying full price for a product they think is on sale. IT'S DISLOYAL AND DISRESPECTFUL. I felt robbed. This brand should be ashamed of itself. You can bet this feedback is also going to google and trust pilot.",

Then [DATE] after the event I was advised there was no CCTV footage and that my request for maintenance records was ignored. It is apparent that Asda condone employing dishonest staff and any allegations of theft, Asda cannot provide the necessary documentation to back up their allegations in a court of law. Going forward I would advise using the manned checkouts as Asda can and will accuse valued customers of stealing at these self scan checkouts, and then try and fob their customers off with unacceptable responses.",

I duly phoned the technical department and after taking it apart I sent photos, as requested, of the hoover and the snapped belt. So one would assume they would send a replacement belt out for it. Oh no. They don't stock indeed sell replacement belts? I had checked on the Internet beforehand but couldn't find any recommended belts just dodgy belts from [ANONYMIZED] parties with mixed reviews.  So I asked what shall I do? Oh take it back to the shop for a replacement or refund? I said this wasn't satisfactory because what happens if I get a replacement and this problem keeps happening and after the warranty period the product is useless because I can't buy any suitable replacement belts. No answer other than they don't sell non perishable items such as belts? I stated so the belt shouldn't break,the answer was that's right. So I said what happens when belt does break. Take back to store if in warranty and you have a receipt. If outside warranty? No answer.  Shocking absolutely shocking.  So I asked what happens to new hoovers like this which are returned? Broken down for spare parts. What about older models which have been well used? Landfill. I can't believe that someone who sells hoovers don't even stock and sell replacement belts they simply fill landfill sites across the [LOCATION] with returned products instead. A simple bely. I was even asked to check instore for a belt? I said what an invisible one? If the Technical team don't have them then the store won't.  I got the impression the person simply wasn't interested.  In all fairness she didn't make the rules etc . So the moral of this is to check and research well before you buy from Asda. How easy replacement parts for products are to obtain or indeed do they even exist.  I personally can't afford to buy belt after belt after belt if those available have mixed reviews on quality and durability of such belts. Simply buy from elsewhere and avoid the hassle ",

The cash machines have been changed to inferior ones and I haven't been able to obtain a receipt in my last [ANONYMIZED] visits.  The shelves have too many spaces on them.  [ANONYMIZED] staff member said that was because online orders were being picked from them and the shelves were only being topped up [ANONYMIZED].

[LOCATION] was \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] yet [ANONYMIZED] in both Boots and Sainsbury's.  That's a rip off.  The staff don't seem at all happy and some will tell you so.  [DATE], there were [ANONYMIZED] tills open despite long queues.  Is ASDA trying to force customers to use self-service tills. It seems like it. ASDA has changed hands a few times and each new owner seems worse than the previous one.  The petrol station is now card only so I won't visit that again.  My understanding is that ASDA was bought with borrowed money before interest rates rose and the new owners are struggling to meet the repayments.  Such purchases should not be allowed.",

        "body": "Actually laughable. Absolutely no customer service at any level. Used the website to search for stores where an item for my nephew\u2019s birthday was in stock. Being someone who isn\u2019t an idiot, I managed ti choose a store pretty local to me that had the item listed as \u201clow stock\u201d which I and anyone with [ANONYMIZED] a brain cell would understand to be different from \u201cout of stock\u201d. Also noted that the stock information for stores was updated regularly so throughout the work day I kept my eye on that store in particular and others around it so I knew I had options if something changed. By [ANONYMIZED] nothing had changed so off I went. Arrived at the Preston store and went to the toy aisle. Not there. But also, not any sign that it had been in stock but now wasn\u2019t because me if the lack of any price on any shelf on that entire aisle that showed the item I was looking for. Annoying but also fairly typical service of a big supermarket at this point. Not to be defeated, I flagged a member of staff, explained the situation and asked if there was any chance they could check stock for me as the website was still showing as it being low stock. As you might imagine, the answer was \u201cif it\u2019s not on the shelf we\u2019ve not got it\u201d. Explained again and asked if they could look. They shrugged and said sorry. Didn\u2019t get the impression there were sorry so I said thanks very much for your help and off I went to ask someone else. Found [ANONYMIZED] members of staff  stood talking, so went over to them. [ANONYMIZED] walked off, clearly not in the mood and the other stayed. Explained again and this time they at least went off to look. They did come back and said they couldn\u2019t see anything. Amazing. So I decided to order online in the end and pay the extra \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] for [DATE] delivery. I still had [DATE]  to source item but thought I might as well to just make sure it gets here. So ordered it at [ANONYMIZED]. [ANONYMIZED] I checked status of the order and it said dispatched, simple. Not really. At [ANONYMIZED] in the afternoon I get a message saying sorry but my package had been delayed but they would still TRY and get it to me that same day and they\u2019d keep me updated. Faith more or less diminished at this point but carried on with my day. A whopping [ANONYMIZED], I get an update. Sorry, there\u2019s been a problem with your order and it\u2019ll be with me within [DATE]. Aside from being too late for what I need item for,  there\u2019s no option on my confirmation email to cancel the order or just simply request a refund. And even in a situation where I\u2019d want to stick with order, in principle I want the \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] back for \u201c[DATE] delivery\u201d. If I want to complain I have to call a number. Wonder why that is? For the sheer audacity of the whole experience I will pursue this and chase it down. Just an absolutely abysmal supermarket. Haven\u2019t shopped here for [DATE] for this very reason and just wanted this specific item that my nephew wanted. What a lesson to be learnt and a way to be reminded why Asda just needs shutting down and leaving it to other companies who know a bit more about running a business. Seriously, just give up. ",

I think he profiled me racially as I can not think of any plausible reason for this rude behaviour. I went back to the store and spoke to the manager. Manger introduced himself as [PERSON] and was not willing to listen or do anything about it. Whitout asking me what happened, he said he will investigate and asked me to go away.

We had no text or email or phone call to notify me. My partner called up the customer service line and explained our shopping had not shown up and they said that they had loads of drivers off sick and it wouldn\u2019t be delivered till [DATE]. They didn\u2019t have the curtesy to call thier customer up to explain that thier workers were off sick. To take my money out of my account and to not deliver or notify me.

Also they left all our food left swimming in milk and that contaminated all our food as the milk was probably off by that point because it wasn\u2019t sealed. We mentioned this to the driver he laughed about the situation which myself and my partner didn\u2019t find amusing and the driver sarcastically said sorry. We had to apologise to our daughter who was starving at this point and get a takeaway even though we couldn\u2019t afford it. We have decided not to order from Asda anymore because the customer service is terrible and not fit for purpose. You should not treat your customers like that fair enough your workers are off sick but as we have paid you still have a duty of care to communicate and let us know so that we know your not stealing our money. Oh yes and we never got no apology when our food eventually did arrive around [ANONYMIZED] on the [DATE]. So we were very disgusted with Asda and the treatment.",

I have even seen rollback prices dearer than the previous price rolled back on.[DATE] I was overcharged for items on a promotional in store rollback which scanned at checkout at full price. [DATE] they have birthday cards on offer at \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] each or [ANONYMIZED] for \u00a3[ANONYMIZED].

Why has this not been fixed if you are aware of the problem?This overcharging despite being against the consumer law now seems to be a very regular thing in Asda and no one gives a toss.

Her tone and behavior were shockingly rude as she shouted at us to leave the store. This treatment left us feeling deeply unsettled and disrespected though we were paying customers, they had seen we did nothing wrong. What added to our dismay was witnessing another group of students from our school, in uniform that were [ANONYMIZED] being allowed to enter without any issue. On the other hand when we were paying we were shouted at and treated with no respect. While it's distressing to consider, the only explanation for disgusting treatment seems to be racial discrimination. I am deeply disappointed and disgusted to experience such discrimination, especially in a place that should be inclusive and welcoming to all customers, regardless of their ethnicity or background. I\u2019m in disbelief that this still happens, it\u2019s [DATE] for crying out loud. It\u2019s scary that still happens in [DATE] and age this is some peoples realities.",

        "body": "I recently visited ASDA Stonecot and unfortunately, I had an incredibly disappointing experience due to the extremely poor customer service provided by the GSM Vania. As a loyal and regular customer, I have always had positive experiences at ASDA, but this particular encounter left me frustrated and dissatisfied.Upon entering the store, I encountered a problem with an item I had purchased [DATE]. I approached the GSM Vania, to seek assistance in resolving the issue. However, instead of displaying empathy and understanding, [LOCATION] was dismissive and unhelpful. She showed a complete lack of interest in addressing my concerns and seemed more focused on rushing me away.Not only did [LOCATION] fail to provide any solutions, but she also displayed a condescending attitude throughout our interaction. Her dismissive tone and lack of professionalism were truly disheartening. As an Asda customer, I expect to be treated with respect and courtesy, especially when seeking assistance from a store manager. Unfortunately, [LOCATION]\u2019s demeanor fell far short of these expectations.Moreover, [PERSON]\u2019s lack of knowledge about the store\u2019s policies procedures and overall products was evident. She seemed unaware of the basic protocols for handling customer complaints and seemed uninterested in escalating the matter or involving other colleague members who might have been better equipped to assist. This lack of competence and willingness to help left me feeling disregarded and unheard.What disappointed me the most was [LOCATION]\u2019s inability to empathize with my situation. Customer service should always prioritize understanding and resolving customer issues promptly. However, [LOCATION] seemed more concerned with maintaining her authority than addressing my concerns. This level of indifference is unacceptable and reflects poorly on ASDA Stonecot as a whole.I sincerely hope that ASDA Head Office takes this feedback seriously and addresses the issue at hand. Customer service is a crucial aspect of any business, and the behavior exhibited by [LOCATION] was far from satisfactory. I urge the senior management team at asda head office to provide additional training to their managers, particularly in the area of customer relations, to ensure that future customers do not encounter the same disappointing experience.In conclusion, my visit to [PERSON] was marred by the extremely poor customer service displayed by the [PERSON] manager, [LOCATION]. Her dismissive attitude, lack of professionalism, and overall indifference towards my concerns were deeply unsatisfactory. I hope that Asda Head Office takes appropriate measures to rectify this issue and provides better training and support to their managers to improve the overall customer experience.",

I have subsequently learned from the store customer services that this store has issues with the payment platform they use and are regularly reporting issues to the provider.

As my shopping arrived [DATE], I noticed the [ANONYMIZED] shampoos, that were not exactly what I ordered, same range but not for coloured hair.

Explaining - price of each item I chose (colour protect version) was \u00a3[ANONYMIZED], offer discount frm original price \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] - great price so ordered [ANONYMIZED]. [ANONYMIZED] substitutes came, left both in the basket - as they have no use for me. The refund came surprisingly for only the one, at \u00a3[ANONYMIZED]. On website to get the proper refund, for the [ANONYMIZED] items I had left in the basket, no option came - I had to call and explain, waited on [DATE], only way to get me the correct refund of \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] ([ANONYMIZED] lousiest groceries online experience possible!!! ---About driver---it was raining, yes very unlucky, but the driver simply left the basked at the pavement by my door, and when i collected it all, and mentioned the unwanted substitution, he mumbled that I could hardly hear him, to leave them there - lucky that I am experience in online groceries shopping and substitutions, and had expected this behaviour - then checked my refund email and noticed it was done for [ANONYMIZED] what it was due...

Customer services advised for me to call at [ANONYMIZED] to hear about when it would come the following day, like I was advised I called up [ANONYMIZED] on the dot to be told it was cancelled but they can put it on for the next available time slot, of course my answer was \u201cbut isn\u2019t that [DATE]?\u201d. Yes was their answer, you gotta be kidding me! I work all day [DATE] where am I going to find time with a [DATE] when I get home at 6[ANONYMIZED] have to get dinner on & get my child to bed at [ANONYMIZED]?! Apologetic so they said they\u2019d call the store when it opens at [ANONYMIZED]! I laughed of course. They open at [ANONYMIZED]!! Bullrubbish after bullrubbish. I went with it, they said they\u2019d contact me. [ANONYMIZED] an email to confirm it had been cancelled, no sorry or anything. I swiftly called them to complain, [ANONYMIZED] x \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] vouchers later for god sakes never ordering from them again so won\u2019t be used on groceries. Anyway, there I was thinking I\u2019ll use the e-vouchers on [PERSON] for some shoes for my little instead. NOPE the e-vouchers are for groceries online only despite me clearly saying I\u2019ll never use them ever ever again. Oh yeah & the vouchers can\u2019t be used in conjunction with each other. It\u2019s [ANONYMIZED] big con. So as clarified like the tune of that [PERSON] Swift song, I am NEVER EVER EVER using Asda groceries again. Constructive feedback to Asda: if you\u2019re not gonna turn up, let us know. Why the hell should I chase you for a service I have paid for? Awful service impacts a much bigger picture than you might think sometimes. A \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] order to you is nothing but for me it makes sure my toddler is fed ready for [DATE] to learn.

I hope she gets rewarded for her kind behaviour and support. I have gone through customer services who was nice but then put me through to the Asda manager who was not very understanding but she was on the shop floor so I\u2019ll give her a break. Though neither took my name number or email so know I won\u2019t hear back. I\u2019ve used this store lots over [DATE] because it\u2019s close to my bus home. The self service tills are more open than the normal person\u2019s tills, which is ok for those in a rush, but not to those elderly or disabled. In [DATE] alone at the self service tills I\u2019ve noticed [ANONYMIZED] or more elderly and disabled customers asking staff to help them scan, and they are refused, myself on crutches due to poor mobility, have noticed no care for myself only questioning me if I paid for my carrier bag, I even picked up something without a barcode and was told I\u2019d better go find one which has one. [DATE] I was in the Romford Asda shopping with my elderly frail mother, it\u2019s hard for us to shop but we do it anyway, carrying a basket on crutches as the small trolleys don\u2019t exist here when I shop. As I was approaching the [ANONYMIZED] open people operated tills a lady told me they was shutting one. And yes the disabled one was being kept open, but I was really struggling. So I asked could I please be served on the till before they shut, I was told no manager wants it shut. I explained I was disabled and she pointed out I was in the disabled till. I said that I was struggling and it would help me, I was told they all say that. I asked to speak to the manager and was told they busy so I did say in haste well if I fall it\u2019s your fault which was wrong on my part. [ANONYMIZED] passed and I fell, a man in the queue did try to help me up and pointed out to the staff member he did ask for help, after I got up a moment passed and I fell again, at this point there was [ANONYMIZED] Asda colleagues around me, the kind lady in the till mentioned above , shouted is none of you going to help him? To the other colleagues she then came round and calmed my mother down and took our shopping round to the self service, as the same guy from the queue helped me up and as I was walking to a seat I fell again. I\u2019m too embarrassed to go back into Asda now as I fear this will happen again. I just hope Asda see this and up their service game for elderly and disabled staff. ",

Even the delivery men are sick of Asda and many have left and that includes in store staff who say they aren't getting paid properly especially for overtime .. they have said that the quality has severely declined and are embarrassed by Asda ... I purchased smoked salmon for my daughter and yep it was substituted with something I couldn't even recognise as salmon... In a flimsy PLASTIC sealed bag the salmon cuttings were floating around in some kind of sliney fluid .. is this the standard they expect us to eat???? I absolutely hate Asda and the thought of even having to shop with them gives me anxiety cos I know I will get loads of subs and produce that's either put of date or almost out of date ...

I got her attention and she simply said I won't be long even though all she was doing was just standing there looking bemused and waiting for another member of staff to help her. We had to move away from our till as there were other people waiting to use it. I approached her and said I'll just wait here by the exit OK. She said OK won't be long. Then wondered off again with my gin and I assumed at last she's going to remove the tag but no she stopped to talk to another member of staff.

They don't have an address for you to send a letter of complaint, so hopefully they as well as  everyone else gets to see it here.Dear Asda Customer Service,I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with a recent grocery delivery order. On [DATE], I ordered groceries for delivery and only received [ANONYMIZED] of the order upon arrival. Luckily, a neighbor who also had an Asda delivery that night confirmed the driver had some unscheduled items in his van, which turned out to be [ANONYMIZED] of my order.  If I hadn't spoken to this neighbor or the driver, I wouldn't have received any groceries at all.I explained to the driver that this was only part of my order, and he assured me he would report the missing items upon returning to the store. [ANONYMIZED], I received a refund email from customer service with a partial refund list. However, there were still items missing from this list.Unfortunately, the online refund request system only allowed me to submit [ANONYMIZED] request at a time, with a maximum of [ANONYMIZED] requests. On top of this inconvenience and frustration, the online refund request system was also time-consuming. I also have to wait [DATE] before receiving my refund. This experience significantly disrupted my plans and ability to complete my work on schedule, forcing me to go out and buy the missing groceries, which cost me additional money as well as valuable work time. This left me feeling frustrated and put me under undue pressure.In a time when many families struggle to make ends meet, I find this level of service completely unacceptable and very concerning, especially considering the additional wait for the refund to be able to purchase the missing groceries.I have been a loyal Asda customer for [DATE], and I hope to continue using your services in the future. However, a more efficient and reliable delivery experience is crucial for me, and I am seriously considering taking my business elsewhere along with all the other services I currently use with Asda.I would very much appreciate it if you could investigate this matter thoroughly and offer an explanation to this fiasco, as well as a solution that demonstrates your commitment to customer satisfaction by offering a small gesture of goodwill.For your reference, I have included my order details below:Order number: ............................Sincerely,Miss .............................If any from Asda cares and would like to look into this, I would be happy to provide you with more details.

I'm not sure exactly how long we were in the queue, but the time stamps on the photos I took on my mobile phone demonstrate that IT WAS [ANONYMIZED]. There were [ANONYMIZED] manned tills open. After we had waited already a long time, [ANONYMIZED] of us went to customer services to complain. In response an announcement came over the public address asking staff to come to the tills. We got hopeful, but nothing happened; [ANONYMIZED], when I eventually got served there were still only the same [ANONYMIZED] tills open. At [ANONYMIZED] point the till operator could not get a price on a box of [PERSON]. She called for someone to give her a price, but no one responded, so she had to go and do it herself and from the slowness with which she did this I suspect that she has mobility issues. We had a chat with her and she said that she shouldn't actually be on the tills. She also said that she was going home in [ANONYMIZED]. I didn't ask if there was anyone to replace her; I suspect not.The store is clearly significantly understaffed. Asda is clearly seeking to maximise profits by saving money on wages, showing contempt for their customers. This can't be good business. The store was very busy [DATE], but I heard so many exasperated people say that they are never coming back. I won't be returning.Even further insult, they have reduced the parking time to [ANONYMIZED]. This didn't register until a customer in the queue told us that she went over the time when she visited on [DATE] because she was waiting so long in the queue and so she was given a fine, but got nowhere when she complained. Customer Services told us to bring the fine to them and they would cancel it.To add further insult, they didn't have any organic whole milk, which is why I went there in the [ANONYMIZED] place",

Just a little thought could rectify this. It is impossible to complain - operators at customer services are obviously reading from a script and don't know how to answer a question that doesn't fit in with the script.

[DATE] sometime she had to do an online order as she would do if she was having [DATE]. When her shopping arrived she asked the driver if he could possibly help her take her shopping up [ANONYMIZED] flight of stairs as she was on her own that day. He was very rude to her and said no we don't carry your shopping we are not insured and if I hurt myself will you pay me my sick pay? He was very loud so she asked him to stop shouting at her and to just leave. She had to wait till her neighbour came home to help her. I told her to complain when it happened but she did not want to get the driver into trouble. We have continued to shop at Asda as we have always said it is good value for money and love shopping there as the staff are very friendly. Since the incident my daughter has placed [ANONYMIZED] online orders which have both been cancelled at the very last minute! We could not understand it but a friend of mine has now told me that she thinks my daughter has been blacklisted because of the incident with the delivery driver! I am appalled that my daughter has not had any feedback from Asda or been given an opportunity to defend herself against the word of the driver. It would have been better customer service if someone could have at least told her why she was not being allowed to do any online orders. I do understand that delivery drivers are not supposed to help the customers if they have to carry the shopping up stairs but she has had some lovely drivers who have offered to help her when they can see she is struggling to carry it up herself, how do the poor elderly people who have got stairs get their shopping delivered? I am so disappointed at my daughters treatment after all our loyal [DATE] of shopping at Asda but  will now take our custom elsewhere where hopefully there is a bit more empathy for disabled customers, I just wish my daughter had complained at the time of the incident so her voice could have been heard, but instead a very nasty and rude delivery driver who was shouting at my daughter for asking for help has had my daughter blacklisted. I will let my friends and family know the situation and can assure you that they too will take their custom elsewhere. This is the [ANONYMIZED] complaint I have sent  regarding this incident and I have not received any response which does surprise me as I always assumed that as like other big supermarkets customers would always get a response about a complaint but obviously I was wrong about Asda. Your shop floor staff  are lovely and always very helpful it's just a shame that the actions of [ANONYMIZED] driver has now caused us to shop elsewhere. I'm afraid I can not remember the date of the incident that has caused all this as it was [DATE] sometime and we have only just realised that my daughter has been blacklisted as no one bothered to actually let my daughter know. The Date of experience given will be the [ANONYMIZED] online order placed and again cancelled without warning and without a reason being given.",

Unfortunately, I was informed that due to staffing, I could only purchase pre-made pizzas after [ANONYMIZED]. This was a minor inconvenience compared to what followed. The store was bustling with online order pickers, which made navigating the aisles quite challenging.When I proceeded to checkout, I encountered long queues at the self-service tills, which were overseen by [ANONYMIZED] staff member. Many tills were experiencing errors, causing further delays. Upon reaching the till and scanning my items, I, too, faced an error while scanning some plums. With multiple customers requiring assistance and no immediate help available, I felt my only option was to abandon my shopping.I understand that staffing can be challenging, but the current situation seems to be affecting the quality of service. I hope this feedback will be taken constructively, as my intention is to see improvements that will benefit all customers.",

I spoke to a polite lady who said I had filled out a form to subscribe, which was not true. Once challenged, she, oddly, caved immediately, offering no proof to support her claim, and agreed to cancel the subscription and refund the \u00a3[ANONYMIZED]. We will see!!! What they do, it seems, is piggyback on major retailers' checkout pages, with the retailer's full knowledge, in this case, Asda. So, Asda then allows them to share the CC details and take the money. There is no form to fill out, and apparently, quite a few major retailers let them piggyback in this way. So be careful to untick and or avoid any box offering cashback. I could go on, but all you need to know is to beware and be extra careful on the ASDA site. My bank was fully aware of the problem with this company, and if you check out Trustpilot, you will see reviews from many very unhappy people claiming sharp practices and outright fraud.",

        "body": "Unfortunately I am once again having to contact you after an unacceptable exchange with the same deputy store manager whom I referred to in this email chain from [DATE]. This happened on [DATE] at [ANONYMIZED]. It started when I was at the self service checkout scanning my items. I was scanning them individually as I get cashback from my bank if I make a certain number of transactions within [DATE], and before long I had [ANONYMIZED] ASDA employees hovering right behind me, watching while I scan the items. I continued to scan them, and then one of the [ANONYMIZED] staff members hovering behind me then asked why I was scanning them individually. I explained that it was because I get cashback from my bank for doing it this way. The staff member then seemed OK with this response and then left. [ANONYMIZED] another staff member asked what I was doing, so I explained it all over again to him. He said that the till was not a cash point. I replied to him stating that I wasn't getting cashback from the self service machine. I gave this staff member a demonstration so he could see how I was scanning and paying for the items. He seemed to understand and then left once he had noticed that I was not actually using the self service till as a \"cash [ANONYMIZED].I then finished up scanning my items and proceeded to leave the store, but the biggest surprise was yet to follow. The store manager, or deputy manager whom I'd spoken to about sorting out the queue management at [DATE] [DATE] accosted me on the way out this time. He aggressively demanded to know what I had been doing and why I was doing it, so I explained it all over again to him for the [ANONYMIZED] time. He was very rude and called me \"odd\" & a \"wrong un\" for scanning my items the way I did. He also instructed me to do my shopping on a [DATE] [ANONYMIZED] rather than a [DATE] lunchtime as it would be less busy and that I wouldn't be clogging up the tills.I found this rich coming from someone who has clearly proved over [DATE] that they have not dealt with queue management at all properly after the feedback I provided in my email of [DATE]. He was instead blaming me as a customer for creating long queues when in fact it's his bad management that was causing it. How [ANONYMIZED] customer can be held responsible for causing long queues is beyond me as \"clogging up\" [ANONYMIZED] self service till would not cause this. Bad queue management might be a more realistic reason for the stores shortfalls rather than blaming [ANONYMIZED] customer. It was not only this that surprised and irritated me, but the terminology the store manager used to label me as \"odd\" and a \"wrong un\". I find this very primitive and wholly unacceptable as it only helped to inflame the situation. Not even [DATE] would this have been acceptable. All in all, it was a very poor showing from Asda and an even more poor showing from the store manager trying to tell me when I can and can't do my shopping in store and the offensive and insulting terminology used to convey his message which borders on being a hate crime. It's the type of behaviour you'd expect from someone who is drunk and disorderly, out on a [DATE] [ANONYMIZED] to engage in [LOCATION] behaviour, but not a store manager. I did explain to him that if he'd have managed the queues better, then there wouldn't have been a problem in the [ANONYMIZED] place, but he wasn't willing to accept this feedback and then just told me to go away.I've been a customer of Asda for a long time and have made many online orders, especially over [DATE] (as you can probably check from my email address), but this experience has left me seething with anger at the vulgarity & bluntness shown by the store manager whom I can only describe as not being a fit and proper person at all, and certainly shouldn't be a store manager if addressing customers in such a repulsive way.[PERSON] be leaving reviews on trustpilot and Google about this store, and will also pass this experience on to the [PERSON]? consumer group. I would like to know from you why this store manager was so abrasive in their dealings with me [DATE] and and explanation of the whole episode as to why he found it necessary to use such offensive language and expect some form of redress for the anger this has caused.People like that shouldn't be working in a customer facing role full stop!I look forward to your prompt response.

I have to stand at the door taking all my products out the baskets and put them on my floor. Sometimes I have to tip all my items out onto the floor because I am agoraphobic I do not like to be stood with my door open for long. This makes it awfully chaotic for me as I am also disabled, then I have to pick all my items up off the floor to take them to the kitchen. It created so much stress and anxiety for me each time I got a shop. If you want to cut down on plastics. Use paper bags!!!!! People get food deliveries for a reason. I have now switched supermarkets so I don't have to deal with all that pain and anxiety anymore.It's really unfair to those with mental health and disibilities and something needs to change. Just use paper bags. Problem solved.Not to mention the substitutes are always nothing remotely similar to what I wanted to order. Stock is always low. Very poor service from Asda.Deliveries are always late and always went to the wrong address and it just caused so much stress every time. Now switched to morrisons. Bye Asda. Hope you resolve these issues for other poor souls who have to struggle like I did with the delivery service. ",

All they could do is cancel my order and we have to wait [DATE] for a refund. Awful service.",

He behaved completely different, ie, [ANONYMIZED] word exchanges when I had someone there - Shame he didn\u2019t realise we have an internal dog cam that records audio! On [DATE] I was at work he came to our address with an order for our neighbour - started shouting at my husband to \u201cring your missus\u201d because he demanded that my husband was wrong in saying we hadn\u2019t ordered. Threatened him when told to get off our property- this was after trying our front door before it was answered! (Also on cctv) Reported it to store, delivery manager initially seemed interested stating he knew who it was before me telling him his name. He advised me there\u2019d been multiple reports about this man\u2019s behaviour yet I was made to feel like an inconvenience later on. Apparently it must be acceptable to let lone females be made to feel that uncomfortable that you need to have someone present for a food delivery as I\u2019ve had no update, apology or anything over [DATE] on. Plus - like many have said, we got multiple ridiculous substitutions that were completely random, and almost every time this man delivered milk mysteriously got burst and things had to be cleaned so he was there longer\u2026\u2026.

Was waiting over [ANONYMIZED], calling customer service and listening that I am next. At [DATE] I cancelled order, nobody was able to tell me how long more it will take and it was already [ANONYMIZED] late. [DATE] same thing, just nobody bothered to let me know. [ANONYMIZED] call to customer service and they told me that car booked down fair enough, happens. They said [ANONYMIZED] min more, after over an hour still no order, called again to hear that [ANONYMIZED], after an hour no order called again to hear it's only 7 min away, after [ANONYMIZED] min still no order, called again to hear that driver has [ANONYMIZED] more customer before me, already [ANONYMIZED] late order, twice heard different timing. The reason to order [ANONYMIZED] is to receive order [ANONYMIZED]!!!! Is it so hard to understand. Asda does not respect customers. I will not shop there again. I pay money to receive service, there is nothing for free and asda is not making me any favor. Customer service are liers, they should tell me the real time of arriving and allow me to decide if I still want to wait. Rude, not respecting people time, not reliable and anyway usually unable to send [ANONYMIZED] of ordered items. The most ugly service I ever received service which I did not received. Wasted over [ANONYMIZED] waiting [DATE] and [DATE]. Hope they will bankrupt and close all shops. ",

I provided receipts for all my items and lowered my shorts to make it completely clear I had stolen nothing, The only things in my shorts were large dressings on my left abdomen from bowel surgery and an illeostomy on my right abdomen, both from surgery for bowel cancer, I had also had previous surgery for kidney cancer and am generally not always well. Security had been told to pull me by some anonymous manager that never showed his face, I asked to see a manager and surprisingly nobody was available, all in a meeting.I returned [DATE] after to see a manager, he was very apologetic and embarrassed by what had happened and advised me to submit a complaint to the store manager as I wanted an explanation as to why someone had accused me of this but it was explained that I couldn't speak to them as I requested, apparently they don't do that, their words. I delivered the complaint [DATE] in [DATE], the complaint was hand delivered to customer services who assured me he would receive it as surprisingly no managers were available again.As of [DATE] I had received no reply so forwarded the complaint to another person at ASDA head office as directed by the ASDA complaints site, as of [DATE] no response again.I have since sent it to ASDA customer services as per internet site, finally got a response, \"email address no longer in use\", talk about making you jump through hoops, there is no clear information on the link returned relating to complaints other than those relating to delivery or goods.

The [ANONYMIZED] time I had complained to the store manager who tried to fob me off by saying, it's the customer who push the older products to the back.When I found a \"use by\" fridge food products which were [DATE] past sitting alongside in date products I was disgusted. I had to search aisles to find someone who I could complain to...all he was he would remove them.I have noticed Asda stores customer service is deteriorating, in the strive to get workers to work faster, mistakes are increasing. When shopping it's so difficult to find anyone to help you, and if you manage to catch up to anyone, they're not really helpful because they're in a rush to empty their cage of products onto the shelf. I had asked [ANONYMIZED] person to tell me where a product was, he told me an aisle number and which side the product was on, when I got there...there was no sign of the product! Not even a price label on the shelves!I wrote an extensive complaint to Asda head office in [LOCATION]. I received a reply letter, not from the complaints manager but a someone in Asda Service Team. Basically echoed what I had complained about, saying \"sorry\", \"we always try our best\". Also they wrote \"We would prefer to resolve issue as to offer a good will goodwill gesture does not rectify your shopping experience\" - the sentence didn't even make sense; the letter can't have been from a complaints manager. There was no gesture of goodwill provided!Finally, the letter stated \"I can understand you're disappointed...also our customer service has let you down on this occasion.\"All of the above are clear indication, in my opinion, that Asda is no longer the friendly store I once used to shop in. Their customer service is now poor/poorer. Their store does not keep better focus on out-of-date products.I no longer trust Asda, nor do I shop there.UPDATEI am so glad to read reviews from Lady S and [PERSON], I thought I might be alone, but no. Asda appear to have little or no focus on out of date foods both in their stores and the ones they deliver. Similar to [PERSON], once when I had reported out of date food, incidentally to a manager, I could not believe what he said \"it's the customers, they push the old foods to the back\"!

        "body": "Appalling Customer Service Experience and Unprofessional Conduct at ASDA [PERSON]-on-TeesI recently had an incredibly disheartening experience at the ASDA [PERSON]-on-Tees branch, and I feel compelled to express my profound disappointment. This pertains not only to the lack of customer service but also to the unprofessional conduct exhibited by [ANONYMIZED] of your employees, [LOCATION] and [PERSON].Upon my attempt to return a faulty item without a receipt, the initial response from [LOCATION] and [PERSON], who were present at the time, was beyond disappointing. Their awkwardness, unhelpfulness, and evident lack of concern for my situation were glaring. Adding to the frustration, [LOCATION], in particular, went so far as to falsely represent herself as the manager, a misleading and unprofessional act.When I requested to speak to the actual manager, [LOCATION] not only declined assistance but exacerbated the situation by addressing me in a disrespectful manner. The entire interaction with both [PERSON] and [PERSON] left me feeling frustrated and undervalued as a customer.Following my visit, I contacted the customer service call centre as advised, providing necessary information such as bank transaction details and the time and date of my purchase with my loyalty card. This information, which should have facilitated a refund or replacement for the faulty item, was blatantly ignored when the call was redirected back to the store. [PERSON], who answered the phone, persisted in asking for an unnecessary till number, a detail I would never be able to recall.This shocking lack of empathy and professionalism displayed by [LOCATION] and [PERSON], coupled with the overall disregard for customer satisfaction, does not reflect well on ASDA as a reputed and customer-centric establishment.I sincerely hope that this review serves as a stark reminder for the management at ASDA [PERSON]-on-Tees to re-evaluate their customer service policies. Customers should be treated with respect and consideration, even in challenging situations. Unfortunately, this recent encounter has left me with a lasting negative impression, and I am hesitant to continue supporting a store that fails to prioritize basic courtesy and customer satisfaction.",

So on [DATE] Jan, we collected our order and the substitutes were no good so we handed them back to the store person. He refunded us straight away, when we got home the chicken had a one day best before date and the braising beef hasd a [DATE]. We claimed the refund with no issue. [DATE] I see on the app that our account has been suspended, I ring up and get passed between [ANONYMIZED] depts before someone takes ownership. Turns out that because we have claimed refunds our account has been suspended.  The payment team finally gets in touch and basically makes it sound like we are criminals for claiming for their poor goods. They will only un suspend us if we abide to hand any poor quality products for a refund to the person who hands us our order. Fine I thought, so [DATE] arrives and when we pick our order up the substitutes are no good, so abiding by their policy and bot wanting to be labeled a criminal, we hand the stuff back and ask for them to be refunded. Yes of course sir says the employee, fast forward [ANONYMIZED] and still no refund, so I email them again and say that I have abided by their policy and what could they do to help us get our money back. Sorry but due to you claiming refunds back we cannot give you the money back, you have to go into store and \u201csee\u201d if they will give you a refund!. To say I was perturbed would be an understatement, I have emailed the CEO of asda but will not hold my breath.

It's scruffy, looks run down uncared for and litter everywhere. The Asda website is like a pile of sphagetti to navigate around, impossible to find an email address, great if you want to chat to a Bot. More self service checkouts than staff and being recorded whilst checking out, whats that all about, if you don't trust your customers then put staff back on tills! But my real complaint is this, Click & Collect Slot time. Fri [DATE] 7:30pm to 8:00pm I arrived at store at Click & Collect at [DATE], no one came out from what looks like a war torn garden shed and at 7.50pm the lights at Click & Collect were turned off on the one and only undercover bay. I tried to gain someone's attention by banging on door along with also trying to gain the attention of the van drivers but to no avail, just ignored. I continued to wait and bang on door until 8.10pm and then gave up. Whilst I appreciate you have an app so customers can announce that they are on their way or have arrived at store, it\u2019s not for everyone for many a reason, but to be parked in a [ANONYMIZED] converted Click & Collect bay in poor lighting, waiting for someone to open what looks like a shed door is pretty bad, no matter which way you want to look or try and defend the situation.[ANONYMIZED] was the last straw for myself, I have been a loyal customer of Asda for many years, but not no more, from a cancelled order in past orders, to orders not being ready on time and having to wait upto an hour, to the quality of the fruit and veg, the truth is Asda seems to for sometime be in decline in [ANONYMIZED] area. The click & collect bay\u2019s I thought were an improvement when they were altered sometime back to accommodate more vehicles, but it ended up a free for all disorganised chaos on busy times and weekends.Words just do not explain how I felt being ignored, shunned on [DATE] [ANONYMIZED] when I could not pick up my click & collect order, but you can be rest assured it won\u2019t happen again, enough is enough Asda as I have gone back to Tesco, I put my [ANONYMIZED] order in with them [ANONYMIZED] ([DATE]), after coming back from yet another pi$$ poor experience with Asda. Tesco have a pleasant online user experience along with also having an orderly system for click & collect where you reverse into an undercover bay with a check-in screen at [LOCATION]. Along with their car park including their collection bays clean and presentable and not something looking like you have arrived at a [ANONYMIZED] slum. Shame on you Asda, your nothing like your adverts portray!",

Told me I'd have to respond to an email he'd send with photos of the damaged item.  Someone would then get back to me within [DATE].Got the email [ANONYMIZED], the text of which didn't make much sense.  Attached the photos and replied.2 [DATE] no response.

So what am I concerned about?Home delivery! [DATE] was the [ANONYMIZED] occasion in [DATE] that I have had to reject groceries because they have been contaminated with cleaning products. I assume the packing is done by humans, and I further assume that there is a lack of common sense when it comes to packing items which are to be transported in a crate, within a van.   Why in the world would anyone with a degree of common sense be placing heavy items on top of items which are fragile or may leak? come to that, why would Asda adopt a process of packing items which may be harmful if consumed in with food items.  For very good reasons, supermarkets generally segregate 'toxic' items such as soaps, bleaches, cleaning products from food items when displaying them for sale. Why then would someone packing those items for delivery choose to store them underneath or along side food items. Even if the food item is contained within packaging, bleaches with cause rust to tins and possible eat through plastics or card. The solution of course is simple. Any of these type of products should be packed into separate spill proof containers and placed in the vehicle separate from food items and at a low level. Though there may be an initial cost in obtaining bespoke containers for this task, I believe it would save Asda huge sums of money in disregarded products and time from the drivers point of view.",

Ruined my new year and what's the point of ordering if you only get [ANONYMIZED] or less of what you paid for, and still have to get to she shops to sort it out and have paid stupid delivery fee. Unless! Costs you more and wastes your time.Ordered again with asda ( my bad !) Very rude driver called Rachel, attitude and unfriendly as you could get ! She dumped my groceries at the front door in trays, walked off back to the van and sat in it to phone me for a bizarre reason. I was already at the front door and opening it at this point and waited for her to return. She could have knocked on the door, pressed the doorbell or ring cam. She did neither which I find bizarre.She got out of the van and this was across the street and yelled \"I was just ringing you!\" Slammed the van door after that and strode over.I said hi but didn't shout back to ask why she didn't ring the door bell and was phoning up, [ANONYMIZED] of those situations I didn't want to get into.Only wanted a few groceries not a difficult driver. She was downright rude in her attitude, gave me a right attitude and passive aggressive tone, muttered WHAT ? Yeah WHATEVER! When I said \"can I leave that substitution please \" then she said \"byyyeee\" in a tone to be unpleasant and funny with me as she left. I'm shocked Asda would even give her a job. Unprofessional, flouts the rules, on a power fight with me is how she came across and generally bitchy rude and cocky and unpleasant. Like dealing with an entitled, school kid that thinks she's too big for her boots and tries to speak down to adults.I don't want someone like that at my house, I'm not ordering from asda ever again after her turning up. Wish I hadn't been so polite to her, when you deal with horrible delivery drivers it's at the point you want to tell them to forget it and shut the door on them than being subjected to rude, passive aggressive, bullying cheeky individuals that encroach onto your property and make you uncomfortable at your front door.Products aren't great. Rocket was replaced with \"pea shoot salad\"  it was vile. Monster energy drinks multi pack sugar free replaced with full sugar cans of something not even similar with chemicals in I am allergic to with anaphylaxis and would cripple me, pipeline punch, I had to refuse it on delivery. Why sub with that?Drivers should turn up within the booking slot, deliver the groceries without issues or an attitude. And then leave. Simple.Starting weird behaviour towards the customer not knocking or doing something off then expecting the customer to engage in it just to create a problem. Not worth the hassle. I'm not tolerating clowns for delivery drivers thanks.",

        "body": "Ref: [ANONYMIZED]-006871Windmill shopping centre /Smethwick Date of incident [DATE] at 16.09pm I visited your store [DATE]  to do my [DATE] shopping on the way out I noticed security guards and a few staff members having an altercation . I assume she stole something or they thought she did not sure which one as I wasn\u2019t listening to the conversation The woman was visibly upset and from my opinion she was vulnerable as she appeared to be either inebriated or in drugs . I cannot tell you what happened or what she said but they searched her and she left the building . I did notice that it wasn\u2019t just security that was dealing with this lady in her space but staff too which to me didn\u2019t seem right and was escalating the situation when it could of been handled in a more professional manner . Customers shouldn\u2019t have to witness a person being hanged up in when security are paid to do that .I proceeded to notice this fracas and walked out to go to my car I was just outside the door leaving the store and I noticed the woman who had been in the store previously and she had slipped and fallen on the ground and pulled herself up while her partner was berating her . To my shock the sales person who I now know as DANIEL proceeded to barge out of the shop as this woman got to her feet and shouted don\u2019t come back you tramp and other obscenities in  front of all the customers outside.You can imagine how shocked I was and I was walking quite near this woman . He seemed unhinged and has anger issues I turned around and went back to speak to them as I was in shock . I told DANIEL that his attitude was appalling and unprofessional to be shouting at a customer in front of other customers. He said to me that she wasn\u2019t a customer and she was being racist another member of staff who was beside him said in a loud vice she called me racist names . Now I am a women of colour myself and what I was hearing was very disturbing . The  staff had basically ganged up on this vulnerable woman and thought it was their right to act like hoodlums because they were offended I am in no way condoning this vulnerable woman\u2019s behaviour at all I am more concerned about the unprofessional way it was handled there  is no excuse . Customers shouldn\u2019t have to listen to Asda staff going on a tirade of abuse to a member of the public . Security are there for a reason and that it what they get paid fir to handle situations like this I do not expect staff to think it is okay to  follow a member of the public out of the store and go in on a tirade of abuse as it certainly doesn\u2019t make customers want to come back . They should have recognised she was vulnerable and acted with a degree of professionalism they did not do that hanging up on a woman security guards and staff is not a good look Everyone who visits your store is a person a human being and should be treated in an empathic manner. This person did not do this and thought he was allowed to treat this person in an inhumane way and their would be no accountability . How I know this is when I told him I was going to make a complaint he said I don\u2019t care and treated me with the same disdain as he did that vulnerable woman and walked off didn\u2019t want to hear it  . I would also like to mention the young woman who thought there was nothing wrong with his response and thought because she felt offended it was okay what  [PERSON] did . I sincerely hope you investigate and take this seriously as behaviour  like this by your staff member is wrong . And the situation could have been handled in a more respectful empathic and humane way . Miss [PERSON]",

I can\u2019t imagine the consequences. I went straight back to the Asda store in [ANONYMIZED] stop shopping centre [PERSON] and asked for a manager, manager did not come out to me except a floor colleague who was quick to take the bag and receipt of me and apologised. I was rushed, the lady on the till to refund me said oh she\u2019s taken the receipt how much were they! It was [DATE] per pot and I had [ANONYMIZED]. \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] was refunded. I didn\u2019t realise until i left the store and driving out the car park what had just happened.

Disgrace.Asda Chicken whole fresh with [DATE] best before were not the actual true best before dates, traces of blood in bag in several during [DATE] as well. Double check your items if you buy from Asda halbeath [ANONYMIZED]. Further update, just opened a bag of Asda cat litter, there is no cat litter in it just grey/black dust instead, and I bought [ANONYMIZED] of those. Awful, I am disgusted with this experience. I would like to add to my review additional rotten frozen vegetables, found to be peas, some mouldy, and green beans mouldy, black and even the branches they grow on. As you can see Asda don't care because they haven't responded to this review.",

Constantly changing where items are.4 Are we still in the pandemic and people still panic buying because the shelves always seem to be empty.5 The amount of times that I have been checked at either the self checkout or [ANONYMIZED] an go I feel that I am classed as a criminal, not the hard working paying customer. If they want to prevent theft then bring back checkouts not computers. PROFITS come from good customer service and relationships.It feels that Asda\u2019s slogan is [ANONYMIZED] to Asda, fight for what little we have left, you do all the work, pay us, we\u2019ll treat you like a criminal and you please say thank you for what little we have provided\u2019.Never thought I would say this please bring back Walmart. The brothers are not able to run a business of this magnitude.Where I live in [PERSON] all of the major supermarkets are small considering that we have a larger population than Burnley the next major town nearest who has a large Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s which all have a better selection than [PERSON] does. Is [ANONYMIZED] of the big [ANONYMIZED] not able to pick up on this????",

A few items were substituted out and it was a bit annoying that I couldn't reject them ahead of the delivery but apparently there was an option to select which items I didn't want to substitute so that was on me for missing it.I chose the cheapest timeslot [DATE] as I wasn't in a rush. [PERSON] arrived right on time at around quarter past and I explained I didn't want any of the substitutes so I left them in the crate and he marked them for refund straight away and took them away. I checked back on Asda and could see the refund is already in process but surprisingly they haven't even taken the money yet so I probably won't get the refund for a while.Quality of food seemed good - meat looked fresh, as did the green veg. My shop was a relatively small shop so not much more to say.I'm relatively young though so although this was a positive experience and saved me time, I should still walk to my local supermarket and carry my groceries back. Still surprised you can only pay \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] and the staff will pack and deliver your groceries for you!Forgot to also add that I called them up before delivery to see if they could just cancel the substitutions to not waste my time or the driver's time but even Customer Service couldn't and they apologised and gave me a \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] voucher lol. I thought I was quite polite and patient and I certainly wasn't demanding anything so I was surprised; I was just pointing out what I thought was logical. So yeah, overall very positive but maybe I was just really lucky.",

        "body": "Regarding [PERSON]; the car park is very badly maintained often with missing or loose metal grids which are a health and safety hazard for customers. More often than not be prepared to get hassled for change as you enter the store through either of the [ANONYMIZED] entrances which is not very pleasant.Added doors to all the fridges making it really hard to find what you want to buy as the glass reflects. You then have to fight with the doors as they try to swing back on you. Aisles are the same size as before, so if there are a few people about it's chaos and you've no chance of easily getting to what you need. [ANONYMIZED] they turn the fridge lights off to make it even more difficult to see. It might be eco friendly but it makes for a very poor and frustrating shopping experience and in my opinion is a ridiculous badly thought out decision.Hardly any tills so enjoy scanning all of your own shopping increasing the profits of Asda as they have to then employ fewer staff. Also recently installed massive chrome fencing as you enter, just to make your shopping trip even more difficult and unfriendly. The Shop and [ANONYMIZED] handset did not work [ANONYMIZED] and I was told to get another which was exactly the same - what a waste of time. If you scan an item to find out the price and don't buy it or goodness forbid change your mind and delete an item, the system selects you for a 'quality check' where a member of staff then has to go through all your bags scanning random items to make sure you're not a thief! Embarrassing and also a hassle. Did I mention prices are often missing or unclear?Stock availability really poor, if you go of an [ANONYMIZED] then expect to see quite a few empty shelves. If you go to Colne or [LOCATION] they will probably have what you wanted - it seems to be an Asda Burnley issue.Prices have gone through the roof and stayed that way, [PERSON] is cheaper on many own brand items and an easier shopping experience all round. Instead of cutting prices, gimmicks like [ANONYMIZED] back on certain products or spin the wheel and win [ANONYMIZED]! have been rolled out. To get this you have to use the Asda Rewards app every time you shop. The app is not very reliable and sometimes you don't receive the advertised bonuses/rewards.To top it all off I was there [DATE] with my young daughter who was feeling unwell. We tried to use the disabled toilet but this was locked! no problem when shopping in Tesco.To summarise, Asda have completely lost their USP. I hate food shopping and [PERSON] is now always a horrible experience!",

We normally shop in store at Asda however we used click and collect for the [ANONYMIZED] time. I picked a [ANONYMIZED] slot [ANONYMIZED] on [DATE] and then proceeded to shop online. [ANONYMIZED] before picking up the order we were emailed that almost everything that was advertised with big savings [ANONYMIZED] wines at [ANONYMIZED] off were not available, party food [ANONYMIZED] for [ANONYMIZED]. All the full price items however were available. I was [ANONYMIZED] very shocked at this our order went from \u00a3185 to \u00a3[ANONYMIZED]! all the discounted items advertised on the front of the website were missing. However the essentials were there so I proceeded to go to click and collect at Asda, when I arrived, cars queued [ANONYMIZED] deep we arrived at [ANONYMIZED] waited until [ANONYMIZED] before getting into a bay. When in the bay it was like nothing I have witnessed after [ANONYMIZED] waiting with other disgruntled customers, I asked how long the order would be as I had to pick my [DATE] up from a sports group. I was told by the Asda employee to be patient, they are understaffed and have [ANONYMIZED] orders [ANONYMIZED] for vans and ours is not available yet.  I then explained I need to pick my son up it\u2019s 8.25pm I have been here since [ANONYMIZED], the lady said I\u2019m really sorry we just can\u2019t cope with the orders [ANONYMIZED]. I said, can I please cancel explaining the situation with my son, yes was her reply I will sort now and you will have an email and refund. I returned home after picking my son up 45mins [DATE] before [DATE] with no shopping. Next I received an email saying I had collected my order and been charged in full \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. I phoned customer services I may aswell have phoned [PERSON] \ud83c\udf85 they read me the script so sorry and an email and refund will be issued. We have know gone through [DATE] and paid for a large grocery order we didn\u2019t receive. Now [DATE], after phoning customer services again they have said don\u2019t worry our process is that on the [ANONYMIZED] complaint we contact payments for you. The customer service representative contacted payments while I waited on the phone, the response has been payments will look into it and issue an email. We are [DATE] down the line, [DATE] has passed and I have still paid over \u00a3100 to Asda for groceries I didn\u2019t receive. This process and service could ruin a families [DATE]. We have shopped at Asda for over [DATE], we will never purchase another item there and would strongly advise any family not to use their online service at [DATE]. Since this has happened to us, numerous people have told us they have experienced the same at Asda and that they switched to Tesco who are by far more professional and easy to deal with if something does go wrong.",

Delivery guy really nice and acknowledged the issue, told me it would be resolved by an automatic refund. This didn\u2019t happen.Unknown chemical went [ANONYMIZED] of the [ANONYMIZED] crates of shopping, smelt horrible, had gone all over dining room table and all over the floor. Took the top varnish off several parts of the table. Contacted customer services, who made matters needlessly complicated. Took several phone calls and emails, whereon I was advised I needed to change the email address on the account. Did so and they still couldn\u2019t receive the photos I was trying to send. Apparently in the space of time I had contacted them their entire customer service account had changed and the same email address didn\u2019t work any further. Eventually they acknowledged  me via telephone and was told I would receive a call from someone soon. This never happened.After [DATE] I decided to call again. I had to explain the backstory again to [ANONYMIZED] people who couldn\u2019t work their own phones and disconnected me (one lady seemed like she couldn\u2019t be bothered even taking the call, the other just seemed like it was his first day). Had to explain again to a [ANONYMIZED] person, who had no access to the information I had already sent via email. Eventually the [ANONYMIZED] call handler assured me however that within a further [DATE] I would receive a response (it being [DATE] to resolve such an issue). The whole process on that particular day probably took over an hour.It\u2019s now over [DATE] and no response whatsoever. I\u2019ve been an Asda customer now for over [DATE] but when we've needed to speak with customer services they really don\u2019t seem to care at all. I don\u2019t really get how they think it\u2019s acceptable for a) this issue in the [ANONYMIZED] place (an unknown chemical all over an entire shop which had spilled to where my [DATE] children eat); b) such poor customer service, probably the worst I\u2019ve encountered; c) no continuity of anyone dealing with anything, even so much as making [ANONYMIZED] outbound call to us; d) not complying with their own timescales. Had there been any degree of acknowledgement/proactivity it would have been really easy to sort - although it\u2019s so strange for a chemical to be all over a grocery shop and even further that it has caused damage to my property, these things may happen from time to time. It hadn\u2019t been intentional. What is worst for me is the fact they simply do not care, and their own complaints service/customer service is ill-equipped, convoluted and needlessly repetitive. Given their response to this issue, and that they clearly don\u2019t take customer service/complaints seriously, will take my business elsewhere and I\u2019ll be taking up this issue with the ombudsman/Office of Grocery Code Adjudicator",

And I think this is the [ANONYMIZED] time I used Asda for my [DATE] shopping? And I wish I never did because yet again it was rubbish service and they mess about with your order too suit themselves? As I needed the things I ordered from online Asda? And they gave me substitutes to that effect and they were horrible didn't like them atall. But yeah again Asda do things to suit themselves and not me the customer. It's always a strain and stress when U deal with Asda a bloody nightmare. And when I don't get what I order and they charge it for there benefit? I go back into the store to c if the product they change? Is in the store and yep they R in the store. So I prove they do things to help them and not me the customer. But unless I get \u00a3[ANONYMIZED]  compensation from Asda. I'm going to stop using them and my family and friends. As being treated like I have and spend my hard working money? Asda R aweful and most definitely not customer friendly when it comes to myself. So I'm going to think long and hard and use another supermarket because Asda attitude stinks and they think they can do or get away with anything they want too. And I'm dammed if I'm going to spend my money in there store again.",

I stopped and looked at him full of shame. He accosted me and accused me of stealing the item I was holding and requested for the receipt, I told him it was a delivery, I am a delivery driver, he barred me from leaving the door and kept shouting and acting very aggressive. I let him know I was given the item by his colleague, he seemed not to be listening to what I was saying. Few customers approached to calm the situation and he only screamed at me never to come to that store because he doesn't want to see me. He was never apologetic. I had to walk out on him with anger to deliver the item. I came back to clarify that I am not a thief and the sales girl who gave me the item kept apologising on his behalf.  I asked to see the manager but he refused to see me. The entire experience was disrespectful and embarrassing for me and I didn't see the need for it as that same manager has seen me countless times and given me items to deliver. I am a customer as well and haven't had this happen to me there before.I would like for this issue to be addressed and dealt with.I refuse to be treated this way by this unprofessional and rude manager.",

Basically, it never arrived despite checking every [ANONYMIZED] mins and leaving [ANONYMIZED] phone numbers. [ANONYMIZED], got through to [LOCATION] on the helpline and was told that driver could not find us - then I was cut off. [ANONYMIZED] was better on the helpline - this time I was told than delivery van broke down - so who was lying? And could they arrange such a simple thing as re-delivery - no - I was then caught in a vortex to try the website, try the FAQs or chat, then your local store, and each time I think I am getting closer, I get the same useless helpline number [ANONYMIZED] 952 [DATE]. Going around in circles. I have work to do! I never blame the hapless helpline staff trying their best to help with their scripted apologies but with no access to local stores, but I feel most angry at the sly managers who hide and organise such a dysfunctional support system that is unable to sort out the most simple of problems - which for me was just to deliver what I have ordered.",

I\u2019ve been ordering from you guys for [DATE], you\u2019ve never started to pack an order so late near a delivery. I then get a voicemail of a team member lying to me, saying that my order cannot be delivered because of a breakdown of a van. I know this isn\u2019t true due to the time the team started packing my order. That\u2019s out of order for starts, id rather just be told a team member forgot to pack it. [ANONYMIZED], they mark it as delivered. It was obviously never delivered as they state in the literal voicemail. I ring up CS [DATE] and ask for a refund, the CSR tells me she has put through the refund and it will be with me in [DATE]. [DATE] go by, no refund. So, i ring up again and another CSA tells me that no refund was processed. So not only did i spend [ANONYMIZED] on food that never arrived, i have no food and no money to buy the food my household needs!you have failed in every step of this process and i\u2019m absolutely furious with the service i\u2019ve received. It\u2019s so close to christmas, how can orders just not be redelivered ? why do you have to just cancel it? we will not have that money by [DATE]. which equates to waiting [DATE] for my money back. and no, a \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] voucher will not suffice with this.Also, a few orders before you decided it was perfectly okay to send me [ANONYMIZED] broccoli with a [ANONYMIZED] maggots in each one.

I\u2019ve come to a conclusion that since asda was taken over it seems to be going downhill and fast might be just my opinion but its not looking good and i will be considering doing my shopping elsewhere.",

At approximately 630pm on [DATE], I was exiting the store when an  elderly female security guard attempted to accost me. I explained I had paid and that, I did not require a receipt as my purchase was via the self service station.  As you may know, when your purchase is approved it gives you the option of printing you a receipt or not, I choose not to take a receipt.I walked [ANONYMIZED] yard to my car in the car park and turned to enter my car only to find that this female security guard had followed me. I was not pleased and stated again I had paid and that I did not require a receipt. I even stated in you look at your cameras you'll see this.  I had purchased [ANONYMIZED] bottles of beer an a chocolate figure for our son (the princely sum of \u00a3[ANONYMIZED]!). There was no reason for her to do this and I got irate with this interaction, she then stated after filming my number plate, that she'd got what she came [PERSON] family have been long time customers of your stores and although I wish to continue to use them, I do not expect to be embarrassed in this way with non stated and unfounded accusations, i.e. that I had stolen from your store.I can, if you require produce my bank statement showing this purchase.

[LOCATION] instead of avocados being [ANONYMIZED] example... It might be a round fruit but I can't spread it on my toast and top it with eggs can I?! Potatoes instead of cauliflower cheese?! I could go on and on.I've been stuck in the house unwell with flu and very annoyingly I forgot to turn off substitutions. I then took the whole delivery in not noticing [ANONYMIZED] of them because I was feeling so unwell and trying to do it quickly. Plus being distracted by the fact that I ended up throwing a large punnet of blueberries over the delivery driver because they'd been damaged in transit and had come open. Think the number of negative reviews for this service speaks volumes. If pretty much your whole order needs to be substituted then it would be nice to receive a phone call before it was due to say would you still like this lame order to be delivered or would you prefer to go elsewhere... If I walked into your store and you didn't have anything that I wanted then I'd go to another store, what's the difference here? Also find it disgusting that you can't use a bluelight card on your website but you can in store? Useless.Shame on you Asda. You don't even bother to take the time to reply to any of these reviews. Mind you, you'd need to hire a whole team for that and if you can't even deliver shopping then I dread to think what your customer service is like.

In [DATE] the substitutions have become laughable and the lack of imagination in their pickers to find an alternative is beggars belief, that so many items are not even replaced with an alternative, they just remove it. The biggest problem with this service has been their customer services team and their delivery drivers inability to use Google maps.We had a delivery due [DATE], the driver could not find the address, made no attempt to contact us and decided he'd cancel the delivery and head home. We tried to complain but customer services are as useful as a chocolate tea pot and the complaints team never get back to you and the complaint originally raised then is still outstanding, despite being told it would be resolved in 48hrs... I called them [ANONYMIZED] more times when this window had lapsed and gave up as was not worth my energy.  We were offered \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] credit by customer services, in way of an apology so gave them another chance for the next driver to also not find our address, cancel the order and head home.... with again no option to reschedule and what's worse is that he still had our groceries on his van and it was the middle of our delivery slot that we spoke to him. We have [ANONYMIZED] young kids and rely on food deliveries and this has made it difficult to feed them and keep basic supplies in the home. This service is nowhere near good enough, departments do not communicate and the systems In place allow too much failure and no flexibility for the customer. This has caused unnecessary stress and is time consuming to chase and deal with. Note we are living in a new build but every other delivery (Inc Sainsbury's who we now use) have been able to find us just fine. Asda just don't seem to care and their customer services are so heavily scripted and coupled with the language barrier, I do not feel they have any actual compassion for the situation and is not just frustrating but infuriating to have to go through these steps and to be hung up on and not have anything resolved, after multiple attempts.

What seemed like an eternity, I eventually got to the checkout and asked the cashier why they weren\u2019t opening another checkout, she shook her head and said, they don\u2019t care, they won\u2019t listen to anyone.

When he finished looked at the receipt I was holding all that time and said \"[ANONYMIZED]\" with the same nasty voice and disrespectfully looking at me, instead of excuse for the inconvenience. Never felt so embarrassed as a customer in my life. Of course people lake him need to mind they duties, but need to be done in a appropriate way, without assaulting customers. Hope ASDA managers keep reminding they workers that customers a the reason for they salaries and need to keep their customer service on top.",

I actually managed to purchase [ANONYMIZED] x Lemsip Max Cold & Flu sachets, there were plenty of them on the shelf and in different varieties both tablet and sachet form. So needless to say I am disappointed.Admittedly the store did not have the soluble [PERSON] that I wanted. As a replacement I purchased ASDA's own brand of Paracetamol Effervescent.Given that in the past I have been provided with alternative products, when the item requested is not available. This may have saved me a trip when feeling unwell. I would like to think that whoever packaged my order would have had enough about themselves to provide alternative replacements, or if they lack this decision making could have sought assistance from a supervisor or more senior colleague.On a slightly lesser dissatisfying point, why does the online shop of supermarkets show items in stock when they are not. I recognise that the response is likely going to be, something to the effect that the online database cannot keep pace with sale of products! You would expect an online supermarket would be able to match the likes of Currys, Craghoppers and alike to tell the consumer whether the items are in stock, and at the point of adding to a shopping basket it is deducted from the stock so other consumers can be informed when they shop.",

I must have missed this time by [ANONYMIZED] or [ANONYMIZED] mins if even that!  I argued my case but was told that a till could not be opened. [ANONYMIZED] of the male advisers told me I could leave my trolley and go if I wanted to. This was an absolute disgrace!!!My son and I ended up having to go through a self checkout and had to call for assistance many times. During some of these occasions we had to wait for [ANONYMIZED] before the attendant was able to come over and assist.During our time checking out I noticed [ANONYMIZED] staff members huddled around the security booth chatting. Can you imagine how this looked! Many customers needing help and [ANONYMIZED] attendant able to supply that help!!! Why were so many staff idle??? Why was a sensible exception not made for a customer wishing to purchase a large number of items?I was unable to help my son due to recent health issues so he had to do all the checking out and packing himself. The self checkout area is[LOCATION] set up for a large shop. Why is this the case? We used up all the space in the backing area and with items still in the trolley, really struggled with the awkwardness of the situation.I shop in Asda [DATE] for a family of [ANONYMIZED]. Why were we as good customers treated so badly? I can\u2019t think of another shop where I would spend \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] and not be spoken to nicely, assisted, welcomed and thanked!!Overall my experience was very stressful and upsetting.

[ANONYMIZED] later the order was shown as \"Delivered\" but this was not the case. The Asda is [ANONYMIZED] away from my home so the tarcking system doesn't work and it not accurate either. I phoned the helpline number and got a woman who was unconcerned and stated that she would hand it over to the payments team. I asked how long a refund would take and she stated [ANONYMIZED]. If I got one. I stated I have CCTV on the door and the snow shows that nobody delivered or came near to me. I alos pointed out that as it's [ANONYMIZED], [PERSON] woould be able to update on where the driver was and if he/she actually did the delivery to my door. The customer services adviser stated that there is no contact between Uber and Asda and her team which is preposterous. No busines can function like this. She had an American Accent and after calling the [ANONYMIZED] number it was re routed to a call which clearly had the [LOCATION] or foreign dialling tone. As I was talking to her I read out my actions as I created a Police Online Crime Report for the Crime. As either the order wasn't packed and delivered which is FRAUD pr the driver took the order, or delivered it to the wrong address. All of these are CRIMES. Next I will call my bank to get the payment stopped so they can't have my money. This is a CRIMINAL way of dealing with people and treating people.",

I thought at the time that all my shopping didn't appear to be there but as Asda no longer give listed print out of what your being delivered I assumed that a lot of things I had ordered was out of stock as I didn't want their substitutes. After packing the shopping away l I then checked my e-mail to make sure that the online delivery matched what I had received to my surprise Asda had claimed that all my groceries had been delivered and nothing I ordered was out of stock.  I Contacted Asda customer services who were very apologetic and informed me that as the driver hadn't arrive back at the depot they couldn't confirm if the rest of my shopping was still on board so they would carry out an initials investigation before issuing me with a refund.  On [DATE] [ANONYMIZED] I received an email from Asda informing me that they were not going to issue me with a refund as I had received refunds in the pass. I again contacted Asda and was again told the same story, to wait while they investigated the missing items only again to receive another e-mail [DATE] telling sorry no refund. 1) I feel that If I need to contact customer services if items which I paid for are missing then it shouldn't be held against me regardless of how many times I contact them. Missing items are missing items and if they not delivered then I am within my rights to tell them so.2) Seeing as Asda no longer provide a list upon delivery we are acting on good faith that all your shopping which YOU PAID FOR has been delivered. [ANONYMIZED]) I am disgusted at the way this has been handled and even more disgusted at your refusal to refund or replace the missing goods. I am now requesting Asda take prompt and effective action to remedy this matter.",

        "body": "Asda Groceries Online failed to respect my delivery request and driver DID NOT deliver as per my request.I was therefore needed to do another delivery request online and waited around 24 hrs more with lack of water and water needed to cook food. I relied on my delivery that it would come like it always did and be left in the porch like the past deliveries. This driver did not do such thing and called me a few times when I couldn't answer the phone. Left me voicemail and said that he couldn't leave it there but gave no reason why. Found all of these later that evening when I arrived tired from work and study only to have no water consumable (delivered). P.s. I consume [ANONYMIZED] water bottled because the nutrients in it makes my kidneys feel ok and doesn't make me feel unwell like other waters or tap water being the worst do. Of course I was upset and annoyed why these happened when this never happened. And of course I left an upsetting comment to [DATE] driver (who thankfully delivered in time and well) BUT it was directed to \"leave the (word***) waters n the (word****) porch\" . This shows that it was directed to my upset, annoyance and previous experience driver that happened, not him, the driver who delivered it as it was understood by him and then reported me.Do you know what happened? My account gets \"Suspended due to behaviour concerns\" like I understood barely [DATE] on the phone. Again, i am asking, how would any regular person at ASDA or otherwise feel if they were in my shoes and not having water to drink or have their meal? Did they ask this question or just plain and simple listened (if they did) to the driver that delivered the waters well because his colleague before couldn't ; thus reporting me without me even knowing why it got suspended when i tried [ANONYMIZED] to use my ASDA Rewards amount.Where is the customer service and satisfaction that it is being said all over ? Is it by suspending my account not even understanding what happened and having a large amount of unspent pounds in Asda Rewards? Not to mention they failed to respond to my query about this over the phone [DATE] when I DIDN'T even know the reason behind suspension then. Also, like they said over the phone, they can come back to the voice recording and see that what I said is very real and the \"customer service\" from \"Payments team\" (as I understand they suspended my account) is lack completely.How \"lovely\" customer service....that deserves [ANONYMIZED] negative stars which is below [ANONYMIZED] or [ANONYMIZED] stars. I will escalate this further if both parties don't come to a good  common ground (me and their services to me like Asda Money Credit Card and [PERSON]) and be more understanding that their colleague driver, first one also failed to meet my request which in the past was met by other drivers well. Thus resulting in all that has happened, along with my frustration and annoyance due to lack of water and being able to my [ANONYMIZED] meal.Also lastly, Asda should look at the good side of customers not ONLY what they thought someone \"done\" because of an event that happened.Good day",

        "body": "I regularly shop at Asda, Boldon. Called in [DATE] to purchase a [DATE] tree, at a cost of \u00a3[ANONYMIZED]. As part of the Asda rewards app, I had a voucher for \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] off when \u201cspending \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] or more on [DATE] lights, trees and decorations\u201d. On scanning the tree, the discount was initially applied, but when I went to pay, the \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] discount had been removed. I queried this with a member of staff who couldn\u2019t explain why the discount had not been applied. [ANONYMIZED] other members of staff attempted to assist but again could offer no explanation as to why the discount had not been applied. They called for further assistance. A small, bespectacled man, wearing a [DATE] jumper, possibly a manager? appeared. He was very dismissive, asking if I had read the terms and conditions of the voucher, which I indeed had, before attempting to make my purchase. He then stated that the \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] discount on [DATE] tree\u2019s applied only to the \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] artificial tree on sale! I asked him, where in the terms and conditions this was stipulated and he was unable to answer this, even after spending over [ANONYMIZED], scrolling through the t&c on the app. He then stated although it was not written anywhere, it was \u201cup to the manager\u2019s discretion\u201d!! Excuse me!! Surely this amounts to false advertising or misrepresentation? It was apparent to me that this manager? was simply making it up as he was going along! Absolutely disgraceful. Shame on you Asda.",

        "body": "Asda home delivery is just THE worst. Out of a \u00a3[ANONYMIZED] shop [ANONYMIZED] of my shopping was delivered, just the cupboard items. We thought the driver was going back to the van to get the rest of our shopping. But he never came back. [ANONYMIZED] x chicken, [ANONYMIZED] x mince beef, all the salad and fresh pasta salad for work lunch, cheese, everything fresh basically and everything I need to cook a meal. I spoke to customer service straight away who were no help. Eventually I was transferred, without being told, to another person who eventually called the Chelmsley Wood Asda Store and told me he spoke to the manager. I made it clear without the meat and fresh items I was unable to cook dinner and as this was over a weeks worth of shopping we would be with out food and I didn\u2019t want a refund just the shopping I had ordered, even offered to go and collect it. But alas, these appears impossible when they don\u2019t deliver your shopping!!  I was told the manager said he would call me as soon as the driver was back. This was [ANONYMIZED]. But nothing, I ended up having to order food on my credit card for the family to eat as it was so late. [ANONYMIZED] I have followed the instructions, marked all the items in the app not delivered as missing, and requested a refund. I then got an email to say the refund has been rejected which meant [ANONYMIZED] on the phone and still no food. I\u2019ve been told as she has the list of missing items a refund will be put through and I will hear from the payment team in [ANONYMIZED]. The refund then still needs to be issued. I\u2019m left in the mean time with no food to feed my family and no refund to be able to do any more shopping. To leave a family like this is disgusting. The staff don\u2019t care, customer services are not bothered and either transfer you to someone else or transfer you to a line that just rings out then finally says \u201cthere is nobody to take you call\u201d and then cut you off, so you have to call again and go through the whole thing again with someone else. The manager of the store doesn\u2019t care and doesn\u2019t even bother calling back when promised to do so, so I\u2019m now left with no meat, or fresh food which included lunch box stuff for my kids and husband. Absolutely disgusting, I am gutted I have gift vouchers left via a hamper company that I thought would help over [DATE] period as I\u2019m forced to have to use them at Asda again when in reality I would rather go to a supermarket that cares about its customers and doesn\u2019t steal food from them and then withhold customers money preventing them buying replacements. Will not be saving for Asda vouchers ever again, what a waste of money, I aste of time and a whole heap of stress trying to get it all sorted.",

        "body": "This is a review for [ANONYMIZED].I have been using Asda for deliveries for [DATE] now, and have noticed a huge reduction in standards over [DATE]. We probably spend [ANONYMIZED] a week there. The reviews you read on here are an accurate view of what it it like to use Asdas online delivery, so if you're also having issues and have come here to review, I suggest you vote with your feet and find another provider.[ANONYMIZED], their stocking is horrific. I appreciate that stock is only live at the time of your shop, and things can change depending on how busy the store is, but we are getting an increasing number of substitutes each week - none of which make sense. We order boneless chicken thighs [DATE], and these have never been fulfilled and are always swapped for boned thighs or even wings?? I'm starting to doubt they even sell them. Every substitute they give us lower value and quality than the original item.I have never ordered a bottle of spirits or champagne that hasn't had the security tag left on. I just get told \"take it in store\", totally negating the point of home delivery. Their meat is so low in quality now, I often wonder where they're sourcing it from. Same goes for their fruit and veg. Often out of next, or dated [DATE].The customer service isn't too bad on [ANONYMIZED], although I'm still waiting for a response to an issue they were made aware of [DATE]. Their call centre is outsourced, often difficult to understand and always reading from a script.The app is glitchy, payments often don't go through. All my refunds are refused, even for out of date food, missing items, etc. We have our [DATE] slot booked with Asda, but I think we'll opt for an actual supermarket shop, as I simply don't trust them to provide any of the items we need. Not to mention, they've had [DATE] items \"coming soon\" on their app since [DATE], but nobody can actually tell me when they'll be available?Their prices have increased enormously over [DATE]. I know everybody has, but Asda really seem to be going over and above what the average increases are. I wouldn't kind if their service had improved, but it's shockingly bad.We've never had an issue with the delivery drivers - they are always lovely, on time and very friendly. Pay the extra and go to a more reliable supermarket. Tesco, [PERSON], [PERSON], they're all a step up from what Asda has become. It's such a shame, as we rarely had issues in [DATE] we've been using them [DATE].",
